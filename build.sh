# in this environment). ALWAYS use this to rebuild the .vescpkg - never
# call vesc_tool --buildPkgFromDesc directly, since pkgdesc.qml points at
# the *generated* ui.qml / package_README-gen.md (both gitignored build
# artifacts), not at ui.qml.in / package_README.md directly. Calling
# vesc_tool directly silently repackages whatever stale ui.qml happens to
# already be sitting on disk - this is exactly what caused v0.1.36
# through v0.1.41 (six releases) to all ship the v0.1.35 UI unchanged.
